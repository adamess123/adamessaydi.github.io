      <h1>Optimal Collection of Pollution Data</h1>
      <div class="content">
          <p>This project was based off of the Budget Maximum Coverage Problem by Samir Khuller, Anna Mossy, and Joseph Seffi Naor.</p>

          <p>Utilizing libraries such a cmath, queue, and vector, I was able to develop an algorithm similar to the pseudocode provided in the paper.</p>
            
          <p>The main purpose of this project is to collect pollution data from data sensors from different areas in a city in a way that maximizes coverage, while remaining within budget. Each data sensor has a certain area that it covers, with any data sensors within that range contributing towards it's weight.</p>
            
          <p>These data sensors are spread out depending on two forms of distribution, normal and cluster. Each cluster in the cluster distribution is set at a certain point in the city. Income is based on the cluster location, and income then determines the asking price of user data.</p>
            
          <p>For convenience purposes, the output displays the improvements my code has over a pure greedy algorithm and a random algorithm. I ran 100k different simulated cities, with each city having 4 clusters. After multiple runs, my program has achieved a consistent 39% improvement over a random selection algorithm, and a 29% improvement over a pure greedy algorithm.</p>
