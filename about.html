        <p>I am an undergrad student at UCF, majoring in Computer Science. My most proficient languages are C++ and Python, 
            although I have experience in several other languages as well. I'm a member of UCF Knight Hacks and Secretary 
            for the Japanese Language Club, which encompass two of my main passions in life.</p>
